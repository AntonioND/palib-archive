Important
=========

This example uses a library called ky_GetURL() which was written by Kumyco (at the PAlib forums), so
thanks to him for allowing me to use his code :)

If you want to use ky_GetURL() just copy the ky_geturl.c and ky_geturl.h files to your source folder
and add #include "ky_geturl.h" below the PAlib include line.
