This is a little tutoraial how to write a GUI.

First of all you have to edit the graphics(included as psd-files).
Of courc you can edit the buttons, move the task-bar to the bottom
or do everything what you want to, but you have to think about the
consequences - you have to edit the position of the button and the
clock in the main.
After editing the background and the task-bar, you have to edit
the menu graphics and add some symbols, maybe.
Now divide the menu into 64x64px squares, reduce the color depth
(the images should have 256 colors at the maximum) and save the as
png.
Finally you have to rewrite the source, an then you have got a
beautiful new GUI. :)
