// List of defines to remove to save rom/ram space :

//#define USE_8BITTEXT   // Remove to not use special 8bit text, which takes lots of space (off by default)

#define TEXT_ALLCHARACTERS    // Replaces the normal default text by a similar one which has pretty much all the special characters... thanks to Morian for that one ! But it takes twice as much memory in video ram, so you can choose which one to include... 

#define USE_KEYBOARD   // Adds the PAlib keyboard...

//#define USE_3D   // Use the 3d functions...
