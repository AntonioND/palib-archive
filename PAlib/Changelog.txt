PAlib 0.66a : 

[Freature] Added tons of Dual Sprite functions, but they are completely untested... (too many functions to test, sorry), and for palettes

[Freature] Added PA_SetScreenSpace(space) to set the desired pixel space between the screens, for the dual functions. On emulator, 0 looks the best, but on DS I like to put 48 (which is the default value).

[Update] Updated the keyboard with a modified version of Headspin's keyboard ! It looks pretty good like that :p If you want to modify the keyboard layout, or add some keys (I left some spaces empty), you can edit the keyboard.bmp file in PAlib/lib/arm9/PA, and post it on the forum, and I'll change it if I feel it's better...   I also updated the keyboard code a little... 

[Feature] Added PA_SetKeyboardColor(color1, color2), which changes the keyboard's color. 0 for blue, 1 for red, 2 for green... Basically, color1 is for the unpressed keys, color2 for the pressed keys. Blue and red by default. Updated the keyboard example to take that into account, you can change the keyboard colors with A, B, X, and Y

[Bugfix] Delfare corrected the installer, it now creates the correct environnement variable for everyone. By the way, uninstall is not available simply because it deletes the whole devkitPro folder... which is not quite what we want ! I'll change that to uninstall just the PAlib folder some time



PAlib 0.65a : 

- Great new installer ! You can chose which components to install (examples, documentation...), and it creates an environnement variable (currently only for c:\devkitPro\PAlib, because NSIS doesn't do it just like I would like, so you'll have to modify the path if you install to another directory...) It uses solid LZMA compression, providing much smaller files than the zip files...
- Added a set of Dual functions -> easy Double screen support ! It's a WIP, so don't expect too much, but I started off with the backgrounds functions... So now, you can load, scroll, and do pretty much anything to a background directly on both screens, just like if there was just one big screen... I'll add support for custom space between the screen, bug corrections, and sprites in the next version. Doing a wrapper for each function just takes too much time right now !
- Updated the version of gfx2gba used in the examples, shouldn't return a warning about extern thingy anymore...


PAlib 0.64e : 

- Delfare's update, with his installer
- Delfare's new text functions !!


PAlib 0.64d : 

- Fixed the compilation errors with the new libnds...


PAlib 0.64c : 

- Pathfinding Fixes



PAlib 0.64b : 

- Fixed the compilation errors on cpp files...


PAlib 0.64a : 

- The documentation is back !!
- Fixed the compilation error some seemed to had (well, should be fixed, I hope...)
- Faster gif decompression
- Support for animated gifs on 16bit backgrounds
- Updated the example makefiles, and added the logos for multiboot and wifime
- Added PA_LoadGBFSImage, for easy loading of Gif, Jpeg, and Bmp from GBFS
- Added support for exporting Bmp's into buffers
- Fixed the problem with PA_SetSpriteAnim not working on sprite initialized with PA_CreateSpriteFromGfx... (untested, but should work)
- Switched the stylus code to the new libnds one... hope it's better for you !


PAlib 0.63a : 

- Fixed the Draw functions to work with different drawing sizes
- Added a Line function with different sizes
- Added a Rectangle function
- Some screens were switched on G6 ! (don't ask me why)... This is fixed (basicly, double-checks the screen on init, and switches if it was wrong)
- Added support for BMP files ! See the GBFS example (but can be used without GBFS). Currently, only supports 16, 24, and 32 bit bmps, on a 16bit background, but paletted bitmaps are coming...
- Added support for GIF files ! Thanks Birslip, and thanks to Libungif... Currently, only did the example to load on a 16bit background, but the functions will be updated soon to work on 8 bit backgrounds (with auto-detection of 8/16bit). This might have made the PAlib size go up some more, but some of the files will be removed later on, and optimisations are still to be done speedwise (I have some ideas I haven't had time to put in place...)
- Changed the makefile a bit :
	-> To easy change author/game name/website, just open the makefile and you'll see where to change...
	-> To add support for gif/bmp files in the data folder
- Lots of bug fixes/enhancements


PAlib 0.62a :

- Added a search for *.extension in PA GBFS system
- Changed the WaitForVBL again, it's even better now, and speeds up the demos on emulator
- Changed all the convert.bat files (gfx2gba...) to have the -align command in them, should fix some sprite problems
- Added 16 bit sprites ! With the example to go with it... Only thing : I discovered that 16 bit sprites need to be 128 pixels large... this means that any sprite size takes up a lot more memory than it takes in 256 or 16 color modes... example : an 8x8 pixel will take as much memory as a 128x8 one ! so 16 times more... 
- Adding 16 bit sprites made me change a line or 2 in the sprite gfx system, apparently it works perfectly, but if you get anything weird, could be my fault... (half-sprites, or double-sprites)
