; Targets configuration file for VisualHAM v2.5+
; ----------------------------------------------

;
;
; Explanation:
;
; All inside square braces [...] is displayed as menu-itemname.
; In case you specify [-], its displayed as a seperator.
;
; Command = This is what is executed when user clicks
;           on that menuitem.
;           This item supports environment strings,
;           like %windir%\notepad.exe for example.
;
; Hint    = A little desciption what this item does.
;           It's displayed when user puts mousepointer
;           over the menuitem and waits a bit.
;
; Shortcut= The assigned keystroke. Use the keystrokemaker
;           to create new keystrokes. The program can be
;           found in the "bin" directory of your VisualHAM
;           installation. If it's not there, feel free to
;           send me an email. If you don't want to assign
;           a keystroke to an item, set it to 0 (zero)!
;

;
;
; Important notes:
;
; Maximal 256 entries supported, should be pretty enough though!
;
; Do only add programs which ends/terminates themself.
; The consoleoutput is captured and linked to the console-
; output, at the bottom of VisualHAM.
;
; The order how these sections are written in this file, is
; the order how they will appear on the VisualHAM mainmenu and
; Toolbar!
