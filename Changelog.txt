

New Stuff
---------

[Tiles] New infinite tile system. Both PAlib and PAGfx have been updated to achieve this. PAGfx now has an InfiniteMap command to convert backgrounds with more than 1008 tiles... Check out the Backgrounds/InfiniteTiles example to see how it works. Example used has 1790 tiles...

[Gif] Added new gif animation commands : PA_GifSetStartFrame(StartFrame), PA_GifSetEndFrame(EndFrame) and PA_GifGetFrame(). Also moved the examples to a separate Gif example folder. GifAnim2 uses these new commands :)

[Gif Sprite] Added a function to convert gif files into tiles... This can be used to create sprites from a gif file ! PA_GifToTiles(gif, palette). Check the Gif/GifSprite example to see how to correctly use it... Good points : takes much less memory, no need for conversions ! Bad points : takes more RAM if you do not free your pointer after use... And is way much slower...

[BG Prio] Added PA_SetBgPrioSeq(u8 screen, u8  priority0, u8  priority1, u8  priority2, u8  priority3), to set the backgrounds in a certain order. 100% not my code, not my idea, I just copy/pasted it ^^ Thanks to sumiguchi for that one

[SpeedTest] Added a series of macros to test the speed of several functions and see which one is the best speed-wise... Check Math/SpeedTest example to see how it works, it's not very intuitive :/

[PAGfx] New exports .bin files in the /bin folder ! To use .bin files instead of .c, simply copy the .bin files into the 'data' directory (create it in the main folder if not there), and include all_gfx.h, but NOT all_gfx.c... This will include the .bin instead of the .c files... Changes have been made both in PAGfx and PAlib to allow further evolution... Because of this, backgrounds converted with this version of PAGfx CANNOT work with older PAlib versions, and files converted with older PAGfx version CANNOT work with this version of PAlib... Sorry :/

[PAGfx/PAlib] Added a new mode in PAGfx : EasyBg... This will automatically select the best mode for the background (between TiledBg, LargeMap, and InifiniteMap). A new set of commands has been created in PAlib to avoid thinking about it : PA_EasyBgLoad(screen, bg_number, bg_name), PA_EasyBgScrollXY(screen, bg_number, xscroll, yscroll)... (ScrollX and ScrollY also available). Editted the examples (not all) to reflect this new stuff. The wiki will be simplified soon as you don't have to think about what type of background you want now (the seperate explanations will be left in an 'advanced tutorial').

[PAFS Backgrounds] Added PAFS/PAFS_Bg to see how to load backgrounds from PAFS ! You have to give it the number of the first background file (name_Info), and put all the .bin files in PAFS...  => PA_FSBgLoad(screen, bg_number, filenumber)

[PAFS Sprites] Added PAFS/PAFS_Sprite to see how to load sprites from PAFS...

[3d+Sprites] Sprites will now work on the 3d screen :D. Just run PA_Init(), and then PA_Init3D(); Added 3d+Sprites example to go with this... Untested on real DS :/

[3d+Backgrounds] Backgrounds can now be used instead of sprites on the same screen as the 3d ! Just run PA_Init, and then PA_Init3DAndBg()... You cannot have both Backgrounds and Sprites when using 3d, sorry ! Important note : Background 0 is NOT AVAILABLE when using 3d, trying to use it will result in wrong display... Added 3d+Bg example to go with this...  Untested on real DS :/

[FPS Counter] Added an FPS counter : PA_RTC.FPS... Yup, that simple, nothing more to do ^^ Check out the Other/FPSCounter example to see it running. It has a simple stress code to be sure the DS won't work at 60FPS, and you can actually change the amount of stress to see the FPS change...


Updated Stuff
-------------

[Examples] Started cleaning up the examples, especially the images, should save a few Mb...

[Examples] Added 16cText2 and 8bitText2, using stdio to output the date and time :)

[Examples] Cleaned the examples... Please delete your PAlib and PAlibExamples folder before updating... Should save some size in the zip and installer, (500-1000kB)

[Examples] Added BinFiles in Background and Sprites to see how it works

[Sound] On by default

[Sound] El Hobito added PA_StopSound(u8 PA_Channel);

[8/16bit Modes] Saved up to 50ko/file when using these modes (Giflib was included by default :s), saved 3ko/file for other .nds files

[PAGfx] Now displays % progression when converting big backgrounds

[Palettes] Added PA_Load8bitBgPal(u8 screen, void *Pal) to load palettes for the 8bit backgrounds :)

[GBFS Sound] Removed the main GBFS sound function, should win a few kB in the rom

[GBFS] Removed the GBFS examples

[Installer] Added German language


Things Fixed
------------

[Linux] Corrected a typo in the makefile which prevented it from working on Linux

[PAFS] Found and fixed a major bug in PAFS. Now should work correctly (it screwed up the file positions when a file was had a size of 4*n - 1 ^^

[PAFS] No longuer includes the files from the hidden .svn directory, sorry for that one ^^

[InfiniteTiles] Fixed all the errors you could have when compiling

[Doc] Fixed a few minor errors, thanks for reporting them :)

[RotBg] Mastertop found a compilation error, thanks :)

[Compilation] Rockard found yet another bug, thanks ^^




PAlib 060905 Fixes :)

New Stuff
---------

[Compilation] No longer requires install.bat :)

[VBL] Added a custom function code in the VBL : PA_VBLFunctionInit(your function) will execute, each and every frame, a given function... This can be used to make counters or have critical codes run at full speed when you're low on CPU time. Be aware that too CPU-expensive functions might slow down your program or hang the DS if run from the VBL !!!    PA_VBLFunctionReset() can be used to stop the custom function. An example was added (Other/VBLFunction)

[2D/3D] Seperated the 2D init (still done by default in PA_Init). You can now use PA_Init2D to return to 2D mode after using 3D functions :)

[Gif] Gif speed now works, only tested on emu for now. Thanks to Shaun for the solution :D Removed PA_SetGifSpeed :p

[Gif] New commands available to change the gif speed while playing and pause it ! PA_GifAnimSpeed(float speed), PA_GifAnimStop, PA_GifAnimPause, and PA_GifAnimPlay. Check out the GifAnim example :)

[Demos] Added the Bunny demo to the demo folder. It shows how to use sprite frames and pixel-perfect stylus collision to create stupid minigames ^^


Updated Stuff
-------------

[Stylus] Now includes Stylus.Downtime and Uptime, to know how long the stylus was held on the screen or off of it (check Input/Stylus2 example to see that in action)

[Stylus] Added Stylus.DblClick, may need more testing though, also in Stylus2 example

[DeSmuME] Reverted back to the old version, this one had 'Hickups' :s

[Giflib] Changed its compilation, saves 4kb ^^

[Doc] Updated the doc


Things Fixed
------------

[Compilation] Fixed the 5 last warnings :)

[Examples] FAT example back, thanks Creebo ^^

[PAGfx] Better declarations in all_gfx.h and .c, with #ifndef and CPP compatible stuff :)

[PAGfx] Now works correctly when you don't precise the Sprite/Bg mode (256colors, etc...) Will take the most common mode by default :) (fixes PAGfx.exe errors and PAGfx Frontend import function

[Draw] Draw functions fixed, thanks to PadrinatoR :)








PAlib 060902 Small features update

New stuff
---------

[Gif] Just couldn't seem to find the option that determines the gif's speed in giflib :/ I added a counter for animation speed, you can set it manually : PA_SetGifSpeed(number of VBLs to wait). 60 VBLs = 1 second between 2 frames. Example available in Bitmap/GifSpeed

[Counters] Added 16 possible VBL Counters : PA_VBLCounterStart(ncounter) to reset and start one, PA_VBLCounter[ncounter] to get its current value. Added an example (Other/Counters) to show it works and to extract seconds from that. Also available : Pause and Unpause :)

[RotBg] Added PA_SetRotMapTile(u8 screen, u8 bg_select, s16 x, s16 y, u8 tile_number), thanks to spinal and gmiller ! Modified the code to work with all background sizes, and added an example (Backgrounds/RotBgTile). Only tested on emulator, will need more tests :)

[Splash] Added PA_SplashEyes() to load the PAlib splash screen with eyes following you ! More splash screens to come when available. Example found in Splash/SplashEyes

[Splash] Added PA_SplashBlue() to load up a Splash Screen based on the forum's logo ! More splash screens to come when available. Example found in Splash/SplashBlue

[PAFS] Added PA_LoadFSImage(u8 screen, s16 FSImage) to load Images (jpeg, gif, or bmp format) from PAFS just by giving the file's PAFS number (no need to know which image format it is !). Added PAFS/PAFS_Image as example to go with it :)

[Pad] Added Pad.Newpress.Anykey, (Held and Released too). Modified the basic Pad example to include that in. Seems to work, please confirm if you have any bug/error (should report any key, but not the stylus)


Things Fixed
------------

[PAGfx] Benualdo correct a bug when exporting 8bit backgrounds, thanks :)

[Examples] Removed some examples that were there twice :s

[Example Fix] Fixed the 3d texture compilation error, not sure if it works though, couldn't test

[Examples] Removed GBFS Gif and Bmp examples (GBFS will be depricated soon), added PAFS examples instead



PAlib 060831 Official Revival Update

[Text] Added TEXT_WHITE, TEXT_RED, etc... macros, thanks to Penjuin. Also updated the TextColors example to show that (using yellow)

[Bugfix] Fixed PA_SetBgColor, thanks to franck569 :)

[Bugfix] PA_ResetBgSys should now leave all screens black, untested though :)

[Bugfix] You can now get the user's name even if he hasn't entered a message ^^ Thanks to PadrinatoR for that one !

[Bugfix ?] A typo, seen by PadrinatoR (again !) was found in the stylus arm7 code. I corrected it, and have no idea what it will change ! If you have any problem with the stylus on this version, please report so that we can revert back to a functionnal stylus code.

[Bugfix] Corrected GBFSInit and migrated to solid function instead of extern inline. Untested, report if problem found... (should we just remove GBFS support and turn towards PAFS, or is everyone still using GBFS or neither one of them ?)

[Bugfix] Corrected a bug in PA_WaitFor ^^



PAlib 060830 Revival Update

[General] Updated my computer to latest devkitPro :)

[Warnings] Fixed most warnings, 5 more left

[C++] Warnings fixed

[Vham] Updated to 2.6, "New Project" now works correctly, thanks for the help ;)

[16c] Put the 16colors text example back in

[Feature] Added PA_WaitFor(something), check the example (Examples/Other) to see how it work : PA_WaitFor(Pad.Newpress.A), etc...

[PAGfx] Updated to version 0.8, which was on my hard drive since... March ! I have no idea how good/bad it works actually, can't remember if it was fully functionnal or not :/



PAlib 060304 MAJOR UPDATE

[PAlib] Changed the compilation to do some real stuff... Now only includes what you use ! A simple demo can be as small as 60kB !

[TextBox] Removed the "1" that was drawn on the bottom screen

[Examples] Tested all of them to check that they compiled and worked with the latest version. Made a general cleanup, so please delete PAlibExamples directory before reinstalling...
	Broken : 16cText, 3D examples using PAlogo (??), Video



PAlib 060304 MAJOR BUGFIX

[Interrupts] Switched to libnds's interrupt handler. Seems to correct some bugs. Superstar's demo seems to work fine with the new system, so I hope this solves lots of C++ problems :S. Corrected 2 other big projects, so it seems like this could be the most stable release up to now ! It probably broke (very temporarily jialing' streaming system (uses TIMERS), we'll just have to switch the code to libnds's timer system, which shouldn't be long, but I ran out of time today :/

[Arm7] Some unwanted test code slipped in the previous version, could cause some major bugs

[16 color Bg] Added a fake 'bitmap' 16 color background system. It's very usefull to draw SHMUP bullets on it (>600 8x8 bullets from what I tested)

[Text Sizes] Added a new text system for 16color backgrounds. Works like the 8bit text (5 different sizes) but is much much faster, and takes much less memory (both in VRAM and in ROM) -> 45k in rom, and around 30k in VRAM (compared to <200k in rom and 49 in vram for 8bit text). Added an example to go with it

[BoxText] Fixed an evil bug that prevented the boxtext from stopping, thanks too Scognito !

[Sprite Priorities] Fixed

[FAT Driver] Chishm updated his FAT driver :
2006-03-03
 * Improved NMMC (MK2 / MK3) driver
 * Optimised LFNs into loops, thanks to dwedit
 * Optimised SuperCard SD CFC7, thanks to Cory1492
 * Added file attribute support
 * Added read only M3 SD support, thanks to SaTa and Moonlight. Disabled by default due to incompleteness
 * Fixed SuperCard SD reading, thanks to Loopy
 * Added EFA2 support, thanks to CyteX

[Version number] Changed the version numbers, I didn't feel like getting to a 1.0 milestone ^^



PAlib 0.998d

[Sound] Fixed :S

[PAGfx] Updated to add 'const' where it was missing... (thanks Jandujar !)

[PAGfx] Removed the #ifndef from all_gfx.h, you can now include it correclty in multiple files

[PAGfx] Shorter lines on error messages

[PAGfx] 2 bug corrections preventing from working if a file wasn't found

[PAGC Frontend] Corrected error when first moving from sprites to backgrounds view

[Text] Fixed the decimal values with negative numbers (thanks to Jandujar !)



PAlib 0.998c

[Examples] Fixed the keyboard example, had SimpleText instead of Text function, so the line break didn't work :S

[Examples] Added Sprite/Priorities2, which shows how the priority system could be used to create a card game, or an isometric 3D system...

[Screen Lights] Rewrote the code, shouldn't break the sound anymore

[Arm7] Switched to libnds's IRQ system, now works better on MK2/3

[PA3D] Compiles again, sorry !

[Backgrounds] Optimised the Background memory error messages

[Palettes] Added PA_SetSpritePalCol

[C++] Fixed the Pad/Stylus problem (replacing bool by u8, I don't like that...)



PAlib 0.998b

[Sprites] Fixed sprites on hardware :/

[Doc] Updated some missing function infos

[Palettes] PA_CreatePalBright added, to create new palette with different brightness level. ChecK Sprite/PalBrightness to see how to use it (can be used on backgrounds too)

[Sprite Priorities] Added advanced sprite priorities, with 256 possible levels ! Check the Sprite/Priorities example to see how it works (requires an init). Beware, this is much slower than the normal priority system, as it requires sorting the sprites...

[LargeMaps] Fixed scrolling bug when background was larger than 256 pixels, but smaller than 512 (thanks Mtom !), and a nice speed increase (up to twice as fast) on large maps (>512)

[Sprite Animations] Fixed a little bug in the frame number when using UPDOWN, thanks to Costello

[FAT Driver] Included Chishm's FAT Driver, with M3, SC, and MK2/3 support ! I take NO credit whatsoever for this. ALL the credit goes to Chishm and the people who helped him make this driver better... If you have any questions/bugs, please report them on palib.com, and do not bug Chishm... The driver takes around 25k, and can be removed by editing PA_Config.h. Please take the time to read the gba_nds_fat.txt file included with the driver...  I haven't played with it too much yet, just tested listing the files on my MK3... (FAT/FAT example). I also update the Vham Init to take into account the FAT_ functions.

[Supercard] Added Akuma's makefile to compile a .sc.nds for supercard users, thanks !

[DualSprites] Added all the animation functions

[SpriteTouched] Speed optimisation

[SpriteTouchedPix] New function, similar to SpriteTouched, but with pixel precision ! Require InitSpriteDraw prior to usage, and is MUCH slower than the normal SpriteTouched function (as you could guess)

[MoveSpritePix] New MoveSprite function, which requires InitSpriteDraw (like TouchedPix), but has pixel-perfect detection, and does not center the sprite on the stylus

[Stylus] Slightly better coordinates (I hope, tried to remove eronous values), and added Stylus.Vx and Stylus.Vy !



PAlib 0.996a

[Sound] Corrected sound (player too fast depending on the function used to play it !)

[Demos] Added tons of new demos (and removed the original Frisbee one, replaced by a new one) with their comments on the wiki (day 12 and day 13). These demos show how to use the stylus at best, and treat about collisions...

[PAFS] Corrected the bug when the filename wasn't PAFS.ds.gba and you still wanted to use the /silence command... Added the possibility to put /silent instead

[PAGfx] Kleevah updated PAGfx and the Frontend, to solve some issues, add an icon, and have a better about box...

[Doc] Updated


PAlib 0.77a : Christmas Release

[Bugfix] MAJOR bugfix for the text, appeared screwed up on the top screen sometimes on DS (not on emulator), now fixed

[PA_Config] Added a 3Ddefinition to PA_COnfig.h, saves 60k when you remove it ! I might turn the 3d off by default for now on...

[PA_Config] Added a keyboard definition to PA_COnfig.h, saves 20k when you remove it, but it will stay on by default in PAlib

[Bugfix] A stylus bug had slipped in when getting at the bottom of the screen ! now fixed thanks to Morian (DS only bug)

[PAFS] Major Bugfix, now should work both in Ram AND Rom... (it used to work only depending on the number of files for some reason)

[PAFS] Removed the press key to exit if you add a '/silence' after the path, puts a log instead, and replaced the old buggy PAFS.exe in all examples but the ram one, had forgotten those !

[PAGfx] Corrected the frontend, which had TiledBg instead of TileBg... minor bugfixes to both the converter and the frontend

[Text] Added #define TEXT_ALLCHARACTERS  to the config file : Replaces the normal default text by a similar one which has pretty much all the special characters... thanks to Morian for that one ! But it takes twice as much memory in video ram, so you can choose which one to include... Will be on by default in PAlib updates... Also updated the small font with a few more characters (like € and others)

[Palettes] Added PA_SetBgPalNCol(bool screen, u8 bg_number, u8 pal_number, u8 color_number, u16 color); (usefull for the 8bit backgrounds... haven't updated the examples yet though)

[Malloc] Added PA_Malloc(void **pointeur, u32 size) for safe malloc... (checks if exists, and if it does, frees before doing the malloc. Thanks Brunni !


PAlib 0.76a :

[PAFS Feature] Started to test some PAFS in ram... this should make it work in emulators and WMB, but is still a work in progress... it works well on one example, but seems to fail on another one, not sure why... Check out the PAFS_Ram example to see how to use it...

[Text Feature] PA_SetTextTileCol(screen, color) is out ! What is it ? It changes the color of the next texts to come... this means you can start writing in white, tell that the rest will be in blue, and have both colors on the screen !!! For now, there are only predefined colors, and color is a number form 0 to 6... Check the TextColors example...

[Minor Fix] Fixed a C++ compilation warning


PAlib 0.75a :

[Bugfix] Text colors now work (emulator+DS)

[Feature fix] Added PA_InitCustomText(screen, bg_select, text) to replace the custom text functions... Text must be converted using PAGfx as TileBg... (the loading function works like LoadTiledBg)

[Feature] Much Lighter roms (lost like 100k) by removing the neoflash and palib splash screens... Moreover, they were added by default (they shouldn't have been). I'll replace them later on with jpegs, which will be way lighter...

[PAFS] Updated PAFS to add 32bit padding to files, should solve some problems. Added mod and sound playing functions and the corresponding example... Will use all that to do the filesystem tutorial on the wiki...

[Examples] Added the gravity example



PAlib 0.74d :

[Bugfix] Fixed the background rotations ! 

[Feature] Updated the rotating backgrounds to work easily with PAGfx -> PA_LoadPAGfxRotBg(screen, background number, bg name, wraparound (0-1))


PAlib 0.74c :

[Animations] Added PA_SetSpriteAnimFrame(screen, sprite, frame) and Added PA_SetSpriteAnimSpeed(screen, sprite, speed)

[Bugfix] Fixed the stylus position error...

[MODIFICATION] Changed PA_PlaySimpleSound(channel, sound), doesn't require '(void*)' and the size anymore ! Changed the example to reflect this...


PAlib 0.74b :

[libnds] Updated to work on the latest libnds update

[Bugfix] Better Sprite Animation code when rapidly changing animation sets

[Examples] Added a nice SpriteAnim2 (using animations, sprite movement, and sprite flipping), and an AlphaBlending example for 1 sprite...

[Doc] Updated the doc


PAlib 0.74a :

[Feature] Added the new sprite animation code ! Check out the example to see how to use 
PA_StartSpriteAnim(bool screen, u8 sprite, s16 firstframe, s16 lastframe, s16 speed (in fps)), PA_StopSpriteAnim(bool screen, u8 sprite), PA_GetSpriteAnimFrame(bool screen, u8 sprite), PA_SpriteAnimPause(bool screen, u8 sprite, bool pause)

[Bugfix] The Text was still broken on hardware, in fact !!! Now it works better... andThis is a temporary fix, which removes custom fonts

[Bugfix] Added the semicolon to PA_Save16bit (yes !)

[Examples] Reworte part of some examples to remove french text and organize them better, added a few examples to go with the wiki...


PAlib 0.73b :

[Bugfix] I think I broke the text functions in .73a, with the extended palettes... this is now fixed


PAlib 0.73a :

[Change] Extended Palettes now used by default for backgrounds (load them with PA_LoadBgPal(screen, bg_number, pal)). The old PA_LoadPal is left for backwards compatibility but should not be used anymore

[PAGfx Update] Integrates better with PAlib Background functions

[Feature] MAJOR update for the background system, has been greatly simplified with PAGfx ! I recommend everyone to go check the simple LoadBgs example to see how it now works. In order to have correct palette names, please do not input palette names for the backgrounds...  PA_LoadTiledBg and PA_LoadPAGfxLargeBg(screen, bg_number, bg_name)...

[Feature] Added 2 random functions (PA_RandMax and PA_RandMinMax), thanks to SuperStar



PAlib 0.72a :

[Feature] Delfare updated the 3d code with some call list functions ! Check the examples :)

[Bugfix] Compilation errors for linux users... again... And added a install.sh for them, too

[Change] Now sets the extended sprites on by default, as it's just better... adapted PA_LoadPal to work with that, and renamed PA_LoadSpriteExtPal to PA_LoadSpritePal (left the ExtPal function for compatibility issues). Updated the sprite examples to take that into account...



PAlib 0.71a :

[PAlibTools] Updated PAGfxConverter to version 0.5. This is a MAJOR update, as it supports backgrounds, sprites, and has Kleevah's nice frontend :)

[Examples] Updated all the examples to use PAGfxConverter instead of gfx2gba

[BugFix] Fixed the PA FS Search function, thanks to Seddy :)

[BugFix] Made the changes suggested by Gooler for compiling under linux, sorry for those !

[Bugfix] Corrected the CPPInstall.bat, should work again, sorry !

[Sourceforge] Removed the PAlib minimal and PAlib examples, please use only the complete packages now...


PAlib 0.70a : 

[Feature] Here comes the first version of PASpriteConverter !!! Beware, it needs the .Net FrameWork to work... 
What so great about it ? Nothing much yet, but great things to come... 
How does it work ? Check out the SpriteConverter example, it's really simple. 
Why do I think it's better to use it rather than gfx2gba ? 
	- Because it handles all image formats (jpeg, bmp, png, etc...), and you don't necessarily need to convert your sprite to a 256 paletted sprite... Though if you have too many colors, it'll fail...
	- You can easily set which color you want as background (Black, White, Green, or Fuschia)

[Feature] PA File System now available !!! What's so great about it ? It's easier to use than GBFS, and takes much less space in Ram (actually, 0, everything goes in the Rom :p), and it supports directories structures !! Currently, only made the PAFS plain example, I'll add the folder example soon, and then convert all the GBFS functions to it. The search functions are already available... PAFS requires the .Net framework in order to work correctly. If you don't have it, either install it, or use GBFS...
I ended up adding the folder example today, to test if it worked, and saw I had a stupid bug, now everything's perfect :p Haven't converted all the functions yet, though. I'm sort of tired of working on this, so I'll continue next week, and tweak it to have the possibility to add the file system in RAM instead of ROM, for all those WMB users :-)

[Feature] Got extended palettes for backgrounds working !! You can all thank Benny for this, he's the one who got me motivated to do it :p  It took like 5-10 minutes to change the old code I had and make it work, should have done it ages ago !!! Anyways, expect PAlib to have Extended palettes for backgrounds and sprites by default very soon, just the time for me to change the basic palette loading functions...

[Minor Feature] Added PA_SetBgColor(bool screen, u16 color), to set the background color... (thanks to SuperStar again :p), and PA_DualSetBgColor(u16 color), to set it to both screens

[Minor Fix] Corrected the unerased character on some stylus examples, thanks to SuperStar


PAlib 0.67a :

[Feature] Now works for C++ projects !!!! Added a CPPInstall.bat, which compiles PAlib to work with C++ projects... This hasn't been fully tested yet, but seems to work :-)  By default, the lib compiles to C, so if you use C++, you'll have to recompile after install...

[Feature] Added PA_SetScreenLight(screen, light), to set on/off one of the screens lights, and the example to go with it...

[Feature] PA_GetGifHeight and PA_GetGifWidth added, pretty self-explanatory...

[Feature] Mode7 comes in !! Not much yet, you can check the example, but more will come soon... I'll just have to... well... rewrite tons of that code :p  So it'll take more time than I thought, but you can already play with this code a little...

[Bugfix]  Fixed the Rotations Background, I hadn't seen I had messed them up by putting 32bit registers instead of 16...

[Update] Updated the 8bit Draw function, should be less buggy. The 8bit and 16 bit Draw functions should be even faster now, when used with big drawsizes



PAlib 0.66a : 

[Feature] Added tons of Dual Sprite functions, but they are completely untested... (too many functions to test, sorry), and for palettes

[Feature] Added PA_SetScreenSpace(space) to set the desired pixel space between the screens, for the dual functions. On emulator, 0 looks the best, but on DS I like to put 48 (which is the default value).

[Update] Updated the keyboard with a modified version of Headspin's keyboard ! It looks pretty good like that :p If you want to modify the keyboard layout, or add some keys (I left some spaces empty), you can edit the keyboard.bmp file in PAlib/lib/arm9/PA, and post it on the forum, and I'll change it if I feel it's better...   I also updated the keyboard code a little... 

[Feature] Added PA_SetKeyboardColor(color1, color2), which changes the keyboard's color. 0 for blue, 1 for red, 2 for green... Basically, color1 is for the unpressed keys, color2 for the pressed keys. Blue and red by default. Updated the keyboard example to take that into account, you can change the keyboard colors with A, B, X, and Y

[Bugfix] Delfare corrected the installer, it now creates the correct environnement variable for everyone. By the way, uninstall is not available simply because it deletes the whole devkitPro folder... which is not quite what we want ! I'll change that to uninstall just the PAlib folder some time



PAlib 0.65a : 

- Great new installer ! You can chose which components to install (examples, documentation...), and it creates an environnement variable (currently only for c:\devkitPro\PAlib, because NSIS doesn't do it just like I would like, so you'll have to modify the path if you install to another directory...) It uses solid LZMA compression, providing much smaller files than the zip files...
- Added a set of Dual functions -> easy Double screen support ! It's a WIP, so don't expect too much, but I started off with the backgrounds functions... So now, you can load, scroll, and do pretty much anything to a background directly on both screens, just like if there was just one big screen... I'll add support for custom space between the screen, bug corrections, and sprites in the next version. Doing a wrapper for each function just takes too much time right now !
- Updated the version of gfx2gba used in the examples, shouldn't return a warning about extern thingy anymore...


PAlib 0.64e : 

- Delfare's update, with his installer
- Delfare's new text functions !!


PAlib 0.64d : 

- Fixed the compilation errors with the new libnds...


PAlib 0.64c : 

- Pathfinding Fixes



PAlib 0.64b : 

- Fixed the compilation errors on cpp files...


PAlib 0.64a : 

- The documentation is back !!
- Fixed the compilation error some seemed to had (well, should be fixed, I hope...)
- Faster gif decompression
- Support for animated gifs on 16bit backgrounds
- Updated the example makefiles, and added the logos for multiboot and wifime
- Added PA_LoadGBFSImage, for easy loading of Gif, Jpeg, and Bmp from GBFS
- Added support for exporting Bmp's into buffers
- Fixed the problem with PA_SetSpriteAnim not working on sprite initialized with PA_CreateSpriteFromGfx... (untested, but should work)
- Switched the stylus code to the new libnds one... hope it's better for you !


PAlib 0.63a : 

- Fixed the Draw functions to work with different drawing sizes
- Added a Line function with different sizes
- Added a Rectangle function
- Some screens were switched on G6 ! (don't ask me why)... This is fixed (basicly, double-checks the screen on init, and switches if it was wrong)
- Added support for BMP files ! See the GBFS example (but can be used without GBFS). Currently, only supports 16, 24, and 32 bit bmps, on a 16bit background, but paletted bitmaps are coming...
- Added support for GIF files ! Thanks Birslip, and thanks to Libungif... Currently, only did the example to load on a 16bit background, but the functions will be updated soon to work on 8 bit backgrounds (with auto-detection of 8/16bit). This might have made the PAlib size go up some more, but some of the files will be removed later on, and optimisations are still to be done speedwise (I have some ideas I haven't had time to put in place...)
- Changed the makefile a bit :
	-> To easy change author/game name/website, just open the makefile and you'll see where to change...
	-> To add support for gif/bmp files in the data folder
- Lots of bug fixes/enhancements


PAlib 0.62a :

- Added a search for *.extension in PA GBFS system
- Changed the WaitForVBL again, it's even better now, and speeds up the demos on emulator
- Changed all the convert.bat files (gfx2gba...) to have the -align command in them, should fix some sprite problems
- Added 16 bit sprites ! With the example to go with it... Only thing : I discovered that 16 bit sprites need to be 128 pixels large... this means that any sprite size takes up a lot more memory than it takes in 256 or 16 color modes... example : an 8x8 pixel will take as much memory as a 128x8 one ! so 16 times more... 
- Adding 16 bit sprites made me change a line or 2 in the sprite gfx system, apparently it works perfectly, but if you get anything weird, could be my fault... (half-sprites, or double-sprites)
